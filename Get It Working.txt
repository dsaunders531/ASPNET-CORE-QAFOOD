Prerequites:

Visual Studio 2017 15.7.4 (community version is OK)
	These workloads will need adding: 
		- ASP.Net and web development
		- .Net Core cross-platform development

These extensions will be useful (Tools->Extensions and updates)
	- Bundler and Minifier
	- CompileSass

ASP.Net Core SDK 2.1.302
	https://www.microsoft.com/net/download
	https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.1.302-windows-x64-installer

The version is important. There have been some changes since earlier versions and the site will not work with earlier versions.

There are 2 projects 'QAFoods', 'mezzanine.essentials'.
The main project is QAFoods, the other project is a library with labour saving features.

Configure the connection strings:
	The web application will throw errors if the connection strings are not configured.
	The application targets SQL Server. A local copy of SQLExpress will also work.
	
	Open the solution QAFood.sln.
		The first time you open the solution lots of things will be downloaded from NuGet.

	Open the file QAFood\appsettings.json
		Add connection string details for Content and Authentication:
		The database details for both of these can point to the same database.
		
		A value like this should be fine for SQL Server or SQL Server Express: Server=[server]\\[instance];Database=[database name];Trusted_Connection=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true
	
	Do not change any other part of the file or its structure!

	Copy the entire contents of appsettings.json to appsettings.Development.json. This file is nested under appsettings.json.

Create the database:
	There are 2 ways to create the database.
	1 - Run the application - it is configured to automatically create and update the database.

	2 - View -> Other Windows -> Package manager console.
		Type 'Update-Database -Context AuthenticationDbContext' at the prompt
		After a while...
		Type 'Update-Database -Context ApplicationDbContext' at the prompt
	

Run the program by selecting QAFood in solution explorer and press F5 key.
